        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            We are Team Kingfisher, an international gaming community with Clans, Tournaments and E-Sports, focused on Supercell Games. 
            We are an English speaking community, originally from India but house people from all parts of the world. 
            We started as a small clan in Clash Royale on 19th July 2020, which was just to seek some fun out of the game. 
            Now, we lead successful clans in multiple games along with regular tournaments and a semi-skilled E-Sports team for Clash Royale. 
            We have earned this position just because of the support by our clanmates and the community, along with the help of our worthy Staff. 
            We are grateful to everyone who has ever been a part of us. Join our Discord to stay updated. 
            Keep Clashing ;)
        </p>
        <p>Team Kingfisher ~ Aim to Glory <br> Since 2020</p>
